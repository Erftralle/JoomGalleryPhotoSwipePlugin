# JoomGallery PhotoSwipe Plugin

## What is this?
JoomGallery PhotoSwipe Plugin is a plugin extension for the popular native [Joomla!](https://www.joomla.org/) image gallery component [JoomGallery](https://www.joomgalleryfriends.net).

The plugin integrates [PhotoSwipe 4.0+](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe) into [JoomGallery 3.2+](https://www.joomgalleryfriends.net). With that, detail and original images can be opened with [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe). The plugin is especially suitable for displaying images on mobile devices because of the swipe gestures control implementation in the PhotoSwipe script, but it also runs on desktop browsers. However, you have the possibility to select an alternative method for opening the images for 'non-mobile' devices.

## Installation
Download a Zip of the plugin code which is ready for installation with [Joomla!'s](https://www.joomla.org/) extension manager. After that the plugin first has to be activated and configured in [Joomla!'s](https://www.joomla.org/) plugin manager. Then, an additional option appears at the respective options for opening images in [JoomGallery's](https://www.joomgalleryfriends.net) configuration manager.
